      {Researched system architectures fitness for conducting real-time TDOA positioning:}\\
      {— Developed architecture capable of positioning an unbound amount of devices in one system.}\\
      {Conducted several attempts to reduce the positioning error to sub-30 centimeter values.}\\
      {— Conducted numerical studies of gathered data to evaluate system performance.}\\
      {Conducted experimental studies on TDOA-positioning system parameters' correlation with the error of positioning.}\\
      {— Used MoCap System as a Ground-Truth Data source.}\\
      {Currently working on finding a plausible real-time reconstruction technique.}\\
      {— Consodering kalman Filter, Particle Filter, Gradient Descent, Analytical Solution.}\\
      {— Prototyping the raw data reconstruction with Python. Next step -- baremetal C code as a firmware.}\\
